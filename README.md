To approach your project on **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) and Brand Equity** in the context of data science with R, I'll outline a structured workflow that aligns with the steps you've provided from your course material and datasets. The main goal is to quantify the short-term and long-term effects of marketing activities on sales and brand equity while optimizing marketing strategies.

# 1. Understanding the Project

## Key Elements:
- **Goal**: Quantify the short- and long-term effects of marketing activities on revenue and brand equity.
- **Data**: Datasets related to sales, special sales, media investment, and NPS (Net Promoter Score).
- **Modeling Approach**:
  - Build a **Marketing Mix Model (MMM)** to evaluate the impact of different marketing channels and variables on **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)** or revenue.
  - Integrate a **Brand Equity model** using metrics like **NPS** and customer loyalty over time to assess brand strength.


# 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning

We will start by cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

## Example steps:
- **Load the datasets** into R using the `read.csv()` function for your `.csv` files.
- **Inspect the data** for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Use functions like `summary()`, `head()`, and `str()` for a quick overview.
- **Handle missing data** using techniques such as mean imputation, or even more advanced methods depending on the dataset.
- **Transform variables** where necessary, like converting categorical variables to factors and ensuring date fields are correctly formatted.

## Code Example:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load datasets
sales_data <- read.csv("path/to/Sales.csv")
media_investment <- read.csv("path/to/MediaInvestment.csv")
nps_data <- read.csv("path/to/MonthlyNPSscore.csv")

# Quick data exploration
summary(sales_data)
summary(media_investment)
summary(nps_data)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(sales_data))
sum(is.na(media_investment))
sum(is.na(nps_data))

# Handle missing values (example)
sales_data <- na.omit(sales_data) # Simple removal of missing values
```

# 3. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)

To quantify the **impact of marketing efforts** (e.g., media investments, discounts, special sales) on sales, you can build a **regression model**. This is typically done using time-series data to measure the contribution of different channels (e.g., digital ads, TV, promotions) to revenue.

## Steps:
- **Feature selection**: Select relevant variables like `GMV`, `Media Investment`, and other marketing-related variables.
- **Modeling**: Fit a multiple regression model (or more advanced models like time series regression) to estimate the effect of marketing variables on sales.
  
## Example Code:
```r
# Build a linear regression model for MMM
mmm_model <- lm(GMV ~ TV_Investment + Online_Investment + Discounts + SpecialSales, data=sales_data)

# Check model summary
summary(mmm_model)

# Visualize coefficients to interpret effects
coef_plot <- coef(mmm_model)
print(coef_plot)
```

# 4. Brand Equity Analysis

For the **Brand Equity** part, you can use **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** or other metrics that reflect customer sentiment and loyalty. The goal is to see how these scores correlate with marketing efforts and sales over time.

## Steps:
- **Calculate correlations** between NPS and sales or marketing efforts.
- **Build time-series models** to assess how brand equity evolves and how it impacts sales.
  
## Example Code:
```r
# Merge NPS data with sales data based on common date or period
merged_data <- merge(sales_data, nps_data, by = "Date")

# Check the correlation between NPS and GMV
correlation_nps_gmv <- cor(merged_data$NPS, merged_data$GMV)
print(correlation_nps_gmv)

# Build a regression model to see how NPS impacts sales
nps_model <- lm(GMV ~ NPS + TV_Investment + Online_Investment, data=merged_data)
summary(nps_model)
```

# 5. Model Validation and Refinement

Once the models are built, it's crucial to **validate** them. You can use techniques like **cross-validation**, split your data into training and testing sets, or apply **time-based splits** for time-series data.

## Code Example:
```r
# Split data into training and test sets
set.seed(123)
train_index <- sample(seq_len(nrow(sales_data)), size = 0.7*nrow(sales_data))
train_data <- sales_data[train_index, ]
test_data <- sales_data[-train_index, ]

# Rebuild the model using training data
final_mmm_model <- lm(GMV ~ TV_Investment + Online_Investment + Discounts, data=train_data)
summary(final_mmm_model)

# Predict on test data
predictions <- predict(final_mmm_model, newdata=test_data)

# Evaluate performance (e.g., Mean Squared Error)
mse <- mean((predictions - test_data$GMV)^2)
print(mse)
```

---

# 6. Report and Visualization

Once the models are validated, you'll need to create **visualizations** and a **report** that presents the findings clearly. You can use **ggplot2** for creating plots to visualize model effects and business insights.

## Code Example:
```r
# Visualize the actual vs predicted GMV
ggplot(test_data, aes(x=GMV, y=predictions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Predicted GMV", x = "Actual GMV", y = "Predicted GMV")
```

# Deliverables:
1. **R Notebook** or script demonstrating the data analysis and model building.
2. **Presentation** summarizing the results.
3. **Report** explaining your methodology, data wrangling, models used, and insights.

This workflow will help you structure your project, and you can adapt it based on specific needs or challenges you encounter during the analysis.
